# R Take-Home Assignments

This repository contains the complete set of R take-home assignments and answers for the PhD course *R Programming for Data Analysis*.

All materials are organised in two top-level folders:

- **Exercises/** – student versions of all assignments (with hints in code blocks)  
- **Answers/** – corresponding instructor/solution versions (same text, filled-in code)

Each folder contains:

- Individual `.Rmd` files (to open and edit in RStudio)
- Pre-rendered PDFs (`all_exercises.pdf` / `all_answers.pdf`)
- A front page explaining how to use the materials

## Getting started: RMarkdown tutorial

If you’ve never worked with **RMarkdown (.Rmd)** files before, start with the short tutorial included in the repository:

- Exercises/RMarkdown_basics.Rmd

or its pdf version:

- Exercises/RMarkdown_basics.pdf

This mini tutorial explains what RMarkdown is, how to open it in RStudio, how to “knit” the file into a report (HTML or PDF), and why this format is used for the assignments. It takes about 10 minutes to complete and will help you understand the format before beginning Assignment 1.

## How to use

You can work with these assignments in two ways:

1. **Using Git** — clone the repository:

      git clone https://github.com/AmsterdamUMC/R-course-homework.git

2. **Without Git** — download the latest ZIP bundles from the  
   [Releases page](../../releases/) and unzip them locally.

Then open any `.Rmd` file in *RStudio*, fill in the missing code where the comments indicate tasks, and click *Knit* to create your own PDF (the tutorial tells you how).

## What you will learn

Across six assignments, you will:

1. **Introduction & patient data**: reading, wrangling, plotting  
2. **Penguins**: exploratory data analysis and visualisation  
3. **COVID**: loops, conditionals, moving averages, flags  
4. **World development** – exploring GDP, life expectancy, and CO₂ emissions  
5. **Statistics with penguins**: intro to t-tests, ANOVA, effect sizes, diagnostics  

Assignment 5 is intentionally a bit more in-depth to provide a gentle introduction to statistics in R.

## Tips for students

- Use the `.Rmd` versions for hands-on work.  
- The PDFs are great as quick references.  
- The **answers** are for review only > try the exercises first!  
- If you’re new to RMarkdown, complete the tutorial first.  
- For help in R, use:

      ?drop_na
      ??"linear model"
      example(lm)
